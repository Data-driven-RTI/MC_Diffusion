# MC_Diffusion
We introduce a data-driven root tuber sensing (RTS) framework that uses the received signal strength (RSS) data from a radio frequency (RF) sensor network to reconstruct cross-section images of root tubers in soils. First, we perform extensive experiments with our data acquisition system in various environments to build a wireless potato sensing (WPS) dataset. Then, we propose a novel deep neural network model, MC-Diffusion, which integrates multi-branch convolutional neural networks with a latent diffusion neural network to enable fine-grained image reconstruction of root tubers. In addition, to mitigate interference from multipath effects, we introduce two domain adaptation methods for MC-Diffusion: one-shot fine-tuning for online model updating and disentangled representation learning (DRL) for transferring pretrained models to unseen environments. Finally, we extensively evaluate the imaging capabilities of MC-Diffusion across multiple scenarios, including root tuber imaging in a static environment (Case 1), robust imaging under environmental changes (Case 2), and cross-environment and cross-soil imaging for underground tubers (Case 3).

For data collection, we design a testbed, Spin, which consists of an RF sensor network with 16 sensor nodes, two types of containers, a rotating platform, and an RGB camera.
