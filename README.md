# MC_Diffusion
We introduce a data-driven root tuber sensing (RTS) framework that uses the received signal strength (RSS) data from a radio frequency (RF) sensor network to reconstruct cross-section images of root tubers in soils. First, we perform extensive experiments with our data acquisition system in various environments to build a wireless potato sensing (WPS) dataset. Then, we propose a novel deep neural network model, MC-Diffusion, which integrates multi-branch convolutional neural networks with a latent diffusion neural network to enable fine-grained image reconstruction of root tubers. In addition, to mitigate the interference from multi-path effects, we propose two domain adaptation methods: one-shot fine-tuning to update the neural network model online, and disentangled representation learning (DRL) to transfer a pretrained model to unseen environments.
